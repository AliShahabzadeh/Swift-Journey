# Swift Journey
Little Pieces of Code to Learn Swift

> Created during some frustrating moments :hand_over_mouth:

## Build and Run
To build the binaries, first navigate to the directory containing the files:
```
cd <DIRECTORY_PATH>
```

Then, compile each file you want to execute:
```
swiftc <TARGET_FILE>.swift
```

Finally, use the following command to run the target binary:
```
./<TARGET_FILE>
```
### Fast Run
o quickly run the files without compiling, use the following command:
```
swift <TARGET_FILE>.swift
```
